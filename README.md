Emerging VM Threat Prediction and Dynamic Workload Estimation for Secure Resource Management in Industrial Clouds

Abstract: The inefficient sharing of industrial cloud resources among multiple users and vulnerabilities of virtual machines (VM)s and
servers prompt unauthorized access to usersâ€™ sensitive data along with excess consumption of power and resource wastage. To
address these entangled issues, this paper proposes a novel Emerging VM Threat Prediction and Dynamic Workload Estimation based
Resource Allocation (ETP-WE) framework that predicts VM threats and resource usage proactively in real-time. The proposed
framework contributes by introducing a Risk-Score Matrix that analyses multiple risks for each VM; utilizing knowledge of proposed
security and workload analyzers for efficient VM Placement (VMP), and estimating resource utilization by developing an ensemble
predictor for prior mitigation of over-/under-load on servers. ETP-WE framework collaborates machine-learning-based security and
workload analysis for secure and resource-efficient VMP, thereby reducing the number of security threats, optimizing resource
utilization, power-consumption, and adapting to the changes in application demands. The performance of the proposed framework is
evaluated using two benchmark datasets OpenNebula and Google Cluster. The simulation-based comparison with state-of-the-arts
validates the efficacy of ETP-WE in terms of reduction of security threats, power consumption, and number of active servers up to
86.9%, 66.67% and 30%-80%, respectively with an improved resource utilization up to 60%-75% over existing approaches.
